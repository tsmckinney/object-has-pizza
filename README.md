# Object Has Pizza
A very simple game engine made in Love2D where each thing is a building block.
WARNING: This project is currently a work in progress. Some stuff might not work as expected, so be on the lookout for new updates and releases, just in case.

## Requirements:
* [Love2D, of course](https://github.com/love2d/love)
* [Classic by rxi](https://github.com/rxi/classic) (It's already included as a submodule)

## Note:
You may have to make a recursive clone, like this:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/tsmckinney/object-has-pizza

This is only because it contains a submodule, as I just said.

## Thanks:
* To rxi for Classic
